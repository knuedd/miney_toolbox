# miney_toolbox

Toolbox to create all sorts of shapes in Minetest (Minecraft clone) via Miney.

So far you can place flat circles, spheres, rectangles and lines at the position of the selected player with a selected material. More to come.

You can also combine shapes, see the snowman example.

The line procedure was adopted from the [recent c't article "Bresenham 3D"](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2021/26/2130115371338876887) in the German magazine c't.
